Simple iOS app and AppleWatch to display Camera live feed using AVFoundation , OpenGL and WatchKit.

* Display iPhone or iPad live feed from back or front camera
* Camera format selection ( Size , frame rate)
* Preview with CALayer (prefered live view)
* Preview with OpenGL (use full for processing frames)
* Preview on AppleWatch (just for testing)


I use this as starting point for image processing and computer vision projects. 
Feel free to use it.
